Which of the following automata models has the most computational power?
A. Finite Automata (FA)
B. Pushdown Automata (PDA)
C. Turing Machine (TM)
D. Mealy Machine
C. Turing Machine (TM)
Consider the type of memory and computational abilities each automaton has access to. Which one allows for an unbounded memory and computation? That might lead you to the answer!

In context-free grammars (CFGs), which theorem states that for any context-free language, there exists a parse tree for any string in that language?
A. Pumping Lemma
B. Chomsky Normal Form Theorem
C. Greibach Normal Form Theorem
D. Parse Tree Theorem
D. Parse Tree Theorem
Think about the fundamental concept that guarantees the existence of a parse tree for any string in a context-free language. It relates to the nature of context-free languages and their structural representation. This theorem establishes a crucial property regarding the formation of parse trees.

Which of the following is true regarding regular languages and context-free languages?
A) Regular languages are a proper subset of context-free languages.
B) Context-free languages are a proper subset of regular languages.
C) Regular languages are equivalent to context-free languages.
D) There is no relationship between regular languages and context-free languages.
B) Context-free languages are a proper subset of regular languages.
Think about the types of languages that each category encompasses. Consider the structure and rules that define regular languages versus context-free languages. One of these types has a broader scope, encompassing the other as a subset due to their differing complexities in terms of rules and expressions.
